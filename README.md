# Contao Dev Bundle

## About
Use this bundle while building a new website.
It let's you overwrite the robots tag and the "no-cache" for all pages based on the current url (dev-domains).
So no development-domain get indexed ever again :)

## Installation
Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org) if you haven't already.
Afterwords, you can add the bundle like this:
```sh
composer require mediamotionag/contao-dev-bundle
```

## Usage
1. Install Bundle
2. Go to Contao Settings to see the options under "Entwickler Einstellungen"
3. Define your development-domains - like: 127.0.0.1,localhost etc.
2. Enjoy
